Cobra (Cobra-cli) is a popular package in the Go ecosystem that provides a robust and comprehensive framework for building modern command-line applications. The Cobra package offers many features and functionalities that simplify building command-line applications in Go.

The Cobra-cli package is built on top of the standard library’s flag package, providing a higher level of abstraction while adding more features. Cobra-cli offers features such as command hierarchy, flag and argument parsing, and subcommands, among others, to make developing complex and feature-rich CLI applications easier.

Popular CLI applications like Kubernetes, Hugo, CockroachDB, and Traefik are written in Go with the Cobra package.
